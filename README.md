# Lib node.js for validating markdown links



My first library created using node.js and tested using Jest, the project is part of Alura's backend course.
This application was created to assist in website management, performing an automated search for links in markdown format, listing them and returning information if these links are working or not. **Execution, correction, repetition. Go Dev!**
